# Corona Safe

Coronaviruses refer to the family of viruses that are known to cause respiratory infections in both animals and humans. There are seven coronaviruses that are currently known to affect humans, out of which four are commonly found across the globe and cause mild cold like symptoms only.

The remaining three are known to  cause severe diseases such as [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS caused by MERS-CoV](https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused by SARS-CoV](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/) and finally [Coronavirus Disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html).

[COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) is a novel coronavirus that has never been previously identified in humans. It is zoonotic in nature, which means it can be transmitted from animal to human, and human to human interactions. It  was first [reported](https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/) from Wuhan City on 31 December 2019.
